[What is ICU?]

A very useful bunch of libraries for handling unicode and internationalization (have a look at http://icu-project.org)

"ICU is a mature, widely used set of C/C++ and Java libraries providing Unicode and Globalization support for software applications. ICU is widely portable and gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C/C++ and Java software.

ICU is released under a nonrestrictive open source license that is suitable for use with both commercial software and with other open source or free software."

[Who uses it?]

[Why the port?]

I needed these libraries for a project and thought this could be useful to others.
