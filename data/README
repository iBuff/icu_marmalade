[ICU data file]

The .dat file can be obtained from http://apps.icu-project.org/datacustom/

Or just use the one I have already.

[Source generation]

We must generate the source code before we can build the library!

* run the appropriate batch file under `gen_source`



[Little vs Big endian]

Due to the way ICU memory maps its data, we need to be aware of the endianess of our target platforms.

This is probably just being a bit over the top as we will pretty much always be on little endian systems.

So I have separated them out into two libraries.
